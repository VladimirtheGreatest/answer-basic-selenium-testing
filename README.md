Instructions As you can see I use require('chromedriver') which means I installed chromedriver locally since my terminal was bugging, if you have your chromedriver version installed globally please make sure you first uninstall it that might be causing issues to run it.

You can clone this repo, open terminal git clone copy the address of this git repo (see the video if you dont know how).
open your terminal and press cd selenium-advanced-testing after cloning .
First npm install selenium-webdriver, (make sure you are in the correct folder path)
In the same path npm install chromedriver (make sure you dont have chrome driver installed globally, if so uninstall it first before installing locally.)
npm install mocha 6.Make sure you are still in the same path, mocha.
I will include the video as well just in case
